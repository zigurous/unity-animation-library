# Data Structures

The Animation Library package includes several data structures to assist in animation-related purposes, mainly when writing custom scripts.

#### [AnimatorParameter](xref:Zigurous.Animation.AnimatorParameter)

An animation parameter that can be set on an Animator. A hash id is automatically created for the parameter. Ids are used for optimized setters and getters on Animator parameters.

#### [SmoothDampFloat](xref:Zigurous.Animation.SmoothDampFloat)

Gradually changes a float over time using a spring-damper function, which will never overshoot.

#### [SmoothDampVector2](xref:Zigurous.Animation.SmoothDampVector2)

Gradually changes a Vector2 over time using a spring-damper function, which will never overshoot.

#### [SmoothDampVector3](xref:Zigurous.Animation.SmoothDampVector3)

Gradually changes a Vector3 over time using a spring-damper function, which will never overshoot.

#### [Timing](xref:Zigurous.Animation.Timing)

The start and end time of an animation.

#### [Timing01](xref:Zigurous.Animation.Timing01)

The start and end time of an animation normalized between 0 and 1.

#### [TimingRange](xref:Zigurous.Animation.TimingRange)

An animation timing range between a lower and upper bound.

#### [TimingRange01](xref:Zigurous.Animation.TimingRange01)

An animation timing range normalized between 0 and 1.

#### [Vector2AnimationCurve](xref:Zigurous.Animation.Vector2AnimationCurve)

Stores a collection of keyframes that can be evaluated over time as a Vector2.

#### [Vector3AnimationCurve](xref:Zigurous.Animation.Vector3AnimationCurve)

Stores a collection of keyframes that can be evaluated over time as a Vector3.

#### [Vector4AnimationCurve](xref:Zigurous.Animation.Vector4AnimationCurve)

Stores a collection of keyframes that can be evaluated over time as a Vector4.
